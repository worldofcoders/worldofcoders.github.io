# Rights & Use
You may distribute the source but not claim rights to the website. I am fine with you using it, as long as you provide credit, optionally, you could provide a link to the GitHub page, but if you don't want to do that then leaving the names of the creator(s) is fine.

We cannot guarantee that by the time you decide to experiment with the code, it'll be broken. If it is broken, you mustn't hold us liable,
this is already covered in the license we're using (MIT) but I'd like to get the message out because of how important it is.

# Self-hosting & Running
> Clone the files into a folder preferably somewhere on your desktop 
(note: I said folder, make a folder on your desktop, first, before you do anything else). 

> Then, open the terminal in the folder by pressing shift + right click, then run: `git clone https://github.com/world-of-coders/woc-website.git` in the terminal to clone the files from here into your folder.

> Once that's done, click on the `index.html` file and you've successfully clone the files. Enjoy!

> Quick Update:
> If you open the terminal on your desktop, and run `git clone https://github.com/world-of-coders/woc-website.git`, that'll work too.

If you spot any errors, feel free to make a PR/edit request. Thanks!
